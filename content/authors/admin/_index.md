Hi there! I'm Zach, I'm currenly a Ph.D. student in the department of Mathematics at the University of Texas at Arlington. I'm currently working under Dr. Ren-Cang Li and Dr. Li Wang in the field of Machine Learning with a focus in Multi-view Learning.  I've been teaching mathematics at the university level and privately over the last few years. When I'm not working, I enjoy running, playing soccer, drinking plenty of coffee and taking many naps.  



### **Technical Skills:**

* MATLAB, R, Python, LaTeX
